# Halo : Innovating Inventory Management At Abeer Pharmacy Limited

## Overview
This project focused on developing an inventory management system that goes beyond just add, edit and delete to provide functionalities and insights that would help them streamline, optimize 
and improve inventory management at Abeer Pharmacy Limited, aiding informed decision making. 



## Abstract:

The job of a pharmacist is one of the most endearing and community-oriented occupations of our day where individuals provide medications for the people around them in order to better
their health and as a result overall livelihood. At Abeer Pharmacy Limited, being a pharmacist is tough, as a high influx of daily customer and archaic means of inventory management leads to constant inventory losses.

Halo is an Inventory Management System that goes beyond the add, edit and delete to provide a more secure, enjoyable and unique experience for these pharmacists.
With the help of innovative functionalities, queries and computations, data and information from Abeer‘s operations, 
operations and interviews are syphoned and used by the system to provide their management with analytical information, 
charts and other insights to help them make informed decisions with their general inventory management, security auditing, restocking, selling practices and employee assessment.

With Halo by their side, efficiency, safety and success is almost guaranteed.
